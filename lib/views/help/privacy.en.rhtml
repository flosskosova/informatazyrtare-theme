<dt id="email_address">Who gets to see my email address? <a href="#email_address">#</a> </dt>

<dd><p>We will not disclose your email address to anyone unless we are obliged to by law,
or you ask us to. This includes the public authority that you are sending a
request to.  They only get to see an email address 
@informatazyrtare.org which is specific to that request.  </p>
<p>If you send a message to another user on the site, then it will reveal your
email address to them. You will be told that this is going to happen.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="nasty_spam">Will you send nasty, brutish spam to my email address? <a href="#nasty_spam">#</a> </dt>
<dd>Nope. After you sign up to InformataZyrtare.org we will only send you emails
relating to a request you made, an email alert that you have signed up for,
or for other reasons that you specifically authorise. We will never give or
sell your email addresses to anyone else, unless we are obliged to by law, or
you ask us to.
</dd>

<dt id="public_request">Why will my name and my request appear publicly on the site? <a href="#public_request">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>We publish your request on the Internet so that anybody can read it and
make use of the information that you have found. We do not normally delete
requests (<a href="#delete_requests">more details</a>).
</p>
<p>
Your name is tangled up with your request, so has to be published as well.
It is only fair, as we're going to publish the name of the civil servant who
writes the response to your request.  Using your real name also helps people
get in touch with you to assist you with your research or to campaign with you.

<dt id="full_address">## They've asked for my postal address! <a href="#full_address">#</a> </dt>

<dt id="postal_answer">No no, they need a postal address to send a paper response! <a href="#postal_answer">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>If an authority only has a paper copy of the information that you want,
they may ask you for a postal address. To start with, try persuading them
to scan in the documents for you. You can even <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/car_parking_charges_policy_and_a#outgoing-532">offer to gift them a scanner</a>, which in that particular case
embarrassed the authority into finding one they had already.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, and you want to provide your postal address privately
in order to receive the documents, mark your request as "They are going to reply by post", and it will
give you an email address to use for that purpose.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="delete_requests">Can you delete my requests, or alter my name?  <a href="#delete_requests">#</a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>InformataZyrtare.org is a permanent, public archive of Freedom of
Information requests. Even though you may not find the response to
a request useful any more, it may be of interest to others. For this
reason, we will not delete requests.
</p>

<p>Under exceptional circumstances we may remove or change your name
on the website.
Similarly, we may also remove other personal information.
