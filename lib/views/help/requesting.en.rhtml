<dd>
<p>It can be hard to untangle government's complicated structured, and work out
who knows the information that you want. Here are a few tips:
<ul>
<li>Browse or search InformataZyrtare.org looking for similar requests to yours.</li>
<li>When you've found an authority you think might have the information, use
the "home page" link on the right hand side of their page to check what they do
on their website.</li>
<li>Contact the authority by phone or email to ask if they hold the kind of
information you're after.</li>
<li>Don't worry excessively about getting the right authority. If you get it
wrong, they ought to advise you who to make the request to instead.
</li>
<li>If you've got a thorny case, please <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a> for help.</li>
</ul>

<dt id="missing_body">You're missing the public authority that I want to request from! <a href="#missing_body">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>Please <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a> with the name of the public authority and,
if you can find it, their contact email address for Freedom of Information requests.
</p>
<p>If you'd like to help add a whole category of public authority to the site, we'd love
to hear from you too.
</p>

</dd>

<dt id="focused">Why must I keep my request focused?<a href="#focused"></a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>
Please put in your request only what is needed so that someone can
easily identify what information you are asking for. Please do
<i>not</i> include any of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>arguments about your cause</li>
<li>statements that could defame or insult others</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you do, we may have to remove your request to avoid problems with
libel law, which is a pain for both you and us. Short, succinct messages
make it easier for authorities to be clear what information you are
requesting, which means you will get a reply more quickly.
</p>

<p>
If you want information to support an argument or campaign, Freedom of
Information is a powerful tool. Although you may not use this site to
run your campaign, we encourage you to use it to get the information you
need. We also encourage to run your campaign elsewhere - one effective
and very easy way is to <%= link_to 'start your own blog',
"http://wordpress.com/"%>. You are welcome to link to your campaign
from this site in an annotation to your request (you can make
annotations after submitting the request).

<dt id="fees">Does it cost me anything to make a request?<a href="#fees"></a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>Making an FOI request is nearly always free.</p>

<p>Authorities often include unnecessary, scary, boilerplate in
acknowledgement messages saying they "may" charge a fee. Ignore such notices.
They hardly ever will actually charge a fee.  If they do, they can only charge you if
you have specifically agreed in advance to pay.

<dt id="quickly_response">How quickly will I get a response? <a href="#quickly_response">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>By law, public authorities must respond <strong>promptly</strong> to
requests.
</p>

<p>Even if they are not prompt, in nearly all cases they must respond within
7 working days. If you had to clarify your request, then they may have more time
(<a href="/help/officers#days">full details</a>).

<p>InformataZyrtare.org will email you if you don't get a timely response.  You can
then send the public authority a message to remind them, and tell them if they
are breaking the law.</p>

</dd>

<dt id="deadline_extended">Deadline extended <a href="#deadline_extended">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>By law, public authorities must needs <strong>more time</strong> for request ... (TO DO)
</p>


</dd>
<dt id="no_response">What if I never get a response?<a href="#no_response">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>There are several things you can do if you never get a response.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sometimes there has been a genuine problem and the authority never
    received the request. It is worth telephoning the authority and politely
    checking that they received the request. It was sent to them by email.
    </li>
    <li>If they have not received it, the problem is most likely due to
    "spam filters". Refer the authority to the measures in the answer 
    '<a href="/help/officers#spam_problems">I can see a request on InformataZyrtare.org, but we never got it by email!</a>' 
    in the FOI officers section of this help. 
    </li>
    <li>If you're still having no luck, then you can ask for an internal review,
    and then complain to the Ombudsperson's office about the authority.
    Read our page '<a href="/help/unhappy">Unhappy about the response you got?</a>'.
</ul>
</dd>

<dt id="not_satifised">What if I'm not satisfied with the response? <a href="#not_satifised">#</a> </dt>
<dd>If you didn't get the information you asked for, or you didn't get it in time,
then read our page '<a href="/help/unhappy">Unhappy about the response you got?</a>'.
</dd>

<dt id="private_requests">I'd like to keep my request secret! (At least until I publish my story) <a href="#private_requests">#</a> </dt>

<dd><p>InformataZyrtare.org is currently only designed for public requests. All
responses that we receive are automatically published on the website for anyone
to read.  </p>

<dt id="multiple">Can I make the same to request to lots of authorities, e.g. all councils? <a href="#multiple">#</a> </dt>

<dd>We ask you to first send a test version of your request to a few
authorities. Their responses will help you improve the wording of your request,
so that you get the best information when you send the request to all of
the authorities. There is currently no automated system for sending the request
to the other authorities, you must copy and paste it by hand.

</dd>

<dt id="offsite">I made a request off the site, how do I upload it to the archive?<a href="#offsite">#</a> </dt>

<dd>InformataZyrtare.org is an archive of requests made through the site,
and does not try to be an archive of all FOI requests. We'll never support uploading
other requests. For one thing, we wouldn't be able to verify that other
responses actually came from the authority. If this really matters to you,
you can always make the same request again via InformataZyrtare.org.
</dd>

<dt id="moderation">How do you moderate request annotations? <a href="#moderation">#</a> </dt>

<dd> 
<p>Annotations on InformataZyrtare.org are to help
people get the information they want, or to give them pointers to places they
can go to help them act on it. We reserve the right to remove anything else.
</p>
<p>Endless, political discussions are not allowed.
Post a link to a suitable forum or campaign site elsewhere.</p>
